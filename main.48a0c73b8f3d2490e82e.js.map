The\n * most common use case is finding all objects that match a query through the\n * <code>find</code> method. For example, this sample code fetches all objects\n * of class <code>MyClass</code>. It calls a different function depending on\n * whether the fetch succeeded or not.\n *\n * <pre>\n * var query = new Parse.Query(MyClass);\n * query.find({\n *   success: function(results) {\n *     // results is an array of Parse.Object.\n *   },\n *\n *   error: function(error) {\n *     // error is an instance of Parse.Error.\n *   }\n * });</pre></p>\n *\n * <p>A Parse.Query can also be used to retrieve a single object whose id is\n * known, through the get method. For example, this sample code fetches an\n * object of class <code>MyClass</code> and id <code>myId</code>. It calls a\n * different function depending on whether the fetch succeeded or not.\n *\n * <pre>\n * var query = new Parse.Query(MyClass);\n * query.get(myId, {\n *   success: function(object) {\n *     // object is an instance of Parse.Object.\n *   },\n *\n *   error: function(object, error) {\n *     // error is an instance of Parse.Error.\n *   }\n * });</pre></p>\n *\n * <p>A Parse.Query can also be used to count the number of objects that match\n * the query without retrieving all of those objects. For example, this\n * sample code counts the number of objects of the class <code>MyClass</code>\n * <pre>\n * var query = new Parse.Query(MyClass);\n * query.count({\n *   success: function(number) {\n *     // There are number instances of MyClass.\n *   },\n *\n *   error: function(error) {\n *     // error is an instance of Parse.Error.\n *   }\n * });</pre></p>\n */\n\nvar ParseQuery = function () {\n  function ParseQuery(objectClass) {\n    (0, _classCallCheck3.default)(this, ParseQuery);\n\n    if (typeof objectClass === 'string') {\n      if (objectClass === 'User' && _CoreManager2.default.get('PERFORM_USER_REWRITE')) {\n        this.className = '_User';\n      } else {\n        this.className = objectClass;\n      }\n    } else if (objectClass instanceof _ParseObject2.default) {\n      this.className = objectClass.className;\n    } else if (typeof objectClass === 'function') {\n      if (typeof objectClass.className === 'string') {\n        this.className = objectClass.className;\n      } else {\n        var obj = new objectClass();\n        this.className = obj.className;\n      }\n    } else {\n      throw new TypeError('A ParseQuery must be constructed with a ParseObject or class name.');\n    }\n\n    this._where = {};\n    this._include = [];\n    this._limit = -1; // negative limit is not sent in the server request\n    this._skip = 0;\n    this._extraOptions = {};\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Adds constraint that at least one of the passed in queries matches.\n   * @method _orQuery\n   * @param {Array} queries\n   * @return {Parse.Query} Returns the query, so you can chain this call.\n   */\n\n  (0, _createClass3.default)(ParseQuery, [{\n    key: '_orQuery',\n    value: function (queries) {\n      var queryJSON = queries.map(function (q) {\n        return q.toJSON().where;\n      });\n\n      this._where.$or = queryJSON;\n      return this;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Helper for condition queries\n     */\n\n  }, {\n    key: '_addCondition',\n    value: function (key, condition, value) {\n      if (!this._where[key] || typeof this._where[key] === 'string') {\n        this._where[key] = {};\n      }\n      this._where[key][condition] = (0, _encode2.default)(value, false, true);\n      return this;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Returns a JSON representation of this query.\n     * @method toJSON\n     * @return {Object} The JSON representation of the query.\n     */\n\n  }, {\n    key: 'toJSON',\n    value: function () {\n      var params = {\n        where: this._where\n      };\n\n      if (this._include.length) {\n        params.include = this._include.join(',');\n      }\n      if (this._select) {\n        params.keys = this._select.join(',');\n      }\n      if (this._limit >= 0) {\n        params.limit = this._limit;\n      }\n      if (this._skip > 0) {\n        params.skip = this._skip;\n      }\n      if (this._order) {\n        params.order = this._order.join(',');\n      }\n      for (var key in this._extraOptions) {\n        params[key] = this._extraOptions[key];\n      }\n\n      return params;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Constructs a Parse.Object whose id is already known by fetching data from\n     * the server.
